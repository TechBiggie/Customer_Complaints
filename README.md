Analysing Customer Complaints at Bank of America: Insights and Trends

## **Introduction**
Customer feedback is crucial for improving services, and analyzing customer complaints provides valuable insights into areas needing attention. This analysis dives into Bank of America’s customer complaints data, focusing on complaint trends by account type, resolution status, complaint channels, and state distribution.

## **Methodology**
This analysis of customer complaints at Bank of America followed a structured approach, focusing on various dimensions like product types, complaint statuses, monthly trends, geographic distribution, and submission channels. The process began with data collection and preparation. The customer complaint data which contains 62,516 complaints between the year 2017 and 2023, provided by Amdora Data analytics Internship Program, was thoroughly cleaned to address any missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies, ensuring an accurate representation of each complaint. Complaints were then categorized by attributes such as product type, complaint resolution status, month, state, and submission channel, allowing for deeper insights into each area.

To better understand complaint patterns, each category was analyzed separately. For instance, segmenting complaints by product type (e.g., checking/savings accounts, credit cards, student loans) helped identify which products were associated with the most complaints. Statistical comparisons highlighted categories with disproportionately high or low complaint counts. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of complaints marked as “closed” or “closed with explanation” revealed important insights about the effectiveness of the complaint resolution process across different product categories.

The time-based trends were examined by analyzing monthly complaint counts. This monthly breakdown helped uncover seasonal patterns, with comparisons revealing significant fluctuations, such as a notable spike in complaints during July. By calculating percentage differences between high and low complaint months, I quantified the impact of these peak periods and explored potential reasons behind these seasonal trends.

The geographic distribution of complaints was analyzed at the state level, providing insights into regional differences in customer satisfaction. Each state’s share of total complaints was calculated to identify areas with disproportionately high or low complaint volumes. This analysis showed that states like California, for instance, contributed a significant portion of complaints. Comparisons of high-complaint and low-complaint states suggested that certain regional factors might influence customer dissatisfaction.

The complaint submission channels were further examined to determine which were most frequently used by customers. Each channel, such as web, phone, or email, was analyzed to determine its proportion of total complaints. The analysis revealed a significant concentration of complaints submitted through the web, hinting at the importance of enhancing web-based customer service tools.

The tools and techniques used in this analysis included Excel and Power BI for data preparation and visualization. Visual tools such as trend lines, bar charts, and maps allowed me to highlight patterns and summarize key findings effectively. Statistical methods, including percentage calculations and comparative ratios, were applied to quantify differences between various categories.

By following this systematic methodology, we uncovered valuable insights into customer complaints at Bank of America. This structured approach enabled us to provide grounded recommendations aimed at improving customer satisfaction and enhancing the bank’s response to complaints.

## **Insights**
The largest share of complaints arises from checking or savings accounts, which significantly outpace other categories like student loans. With 24,814 complaints, checking or savings accounts account for nearly 40% of all complaints. This high volume suggests underlying issues within these account types, potentially pointing to dissatisfaction with fees, transaction processing times, or account maintenance services. In contrast, student loans generated the fewest complaints, indicating that Bank of America might have a smoother experience in this area or fewer interactions due to a smaller user base.

Closures of complaints with explanations or financial relief show that customer grievances are often addressed with a resolution, yet there is room for improvement. Closed cases without clear explanations can leave customers feeling unheard, suggesting that transparency is essential in complaint resolution. The data also shows a strong correlation between the total number of complaints and the number that are ultimately closed, which may reflect a streamlined process. However, closing complaints with adequate explanations or fair monetary relief could further build trust among customers, enhancing their overall perception of the bank.

Seasonal trends indicate that complaints peak in July, accounting for 10.36% of the annual total, while February experiences the fewest complaints. This seasonal shift might be related to financial cycles, such as mid-year spending, vacations, or fiscal policies that impact customer banking activities. Recognizing and preparing for peak complaint times can enable the bank to allocate resources effectively, minimizing wait times and improving the speed of complaint resolution.

Geographically, California, Florida, and Texas report the highest volumes of complaints, with California alone representing 21.93% of the total. These states, being highly populated, likely contribute to the higher complaint numbers. However, region-specific factors such as state regulations or local economic conditions may also influence the rate of complaints. Targeted initiatives addressing regional concerns or enhancing customer service responsiveness in these high-complaint states could be effective strategies for improving service satisfaction.

Finally, the data on channels used to submit complaints reveals that the web platform is by far the most utilized, representing 72.66% of all complaints, while email ranks the lowest. This preference for online submissions suggests that customers expect digital-first service and support options, but it also highlights the potential for improving alternative channels like phone or email for those who may require additional assistance or more personalized service.

It’s worth it to note that there’s a timely response of 96.06%. This indicates that BoA treats its customers’ complaints as an emergency.

## **Recommendations**
Addressing customer complaints effectively is essential for building trust and satisfaction. Based on the analysis of complaint patterns, here are some tailored recommendations for Bank of America to improve its service and enhance customer experiences.

First, improving the checking and savings account services should be a top priority. With nearly 40% of all complaints centered around these account types, there is a clear opportunity to address common pain points. A thorough review of fees, transaction processing, and customer service support could reveal key areas for improvement. Making these adjustments can help reduce complaints and foster customer loyalty by showing that the bank is proactive in addressing concerns.

Transparency in complaint resolution is also crucial. Customers want to feel heard and valued, and providing clear, thorough explanations for complaint closures is one way to achieve this. Ensuring that each closed complaint is accompanied by a well-documented explanation—or, where appropriate, monetary relief—will not only improve customer satisfaction but also strengthen trust. Customers who feel they are treated fairly are more likely to stay loyal and speak positively about their experience.

Planning for seasonal variations in complaint volume can significantly improve customer service efficiency. Since complaints peak in July, resource allocation can be adjusted to ensure adequate staffing and support during this period. By preparing for high-volume months, the bank can minimize wait times and deliver a more seamless customer experience. This approach demonstrates foresight and a commitment to handling complaints swiftly and effectively, even during peak times.

Geographically, focusing on regions with high complaint volumes can help target specific needs. California, Florida, and Texas account for a large share of complaints, suggesting there may be region-specific challenges that customers face. Implementing targeted customer service strategies, such as additional training for representatives in these states or tailored communication for customers in high-complaint regions, can make a positive impact. By addressing regional concerns, the bank shows an understanding of localized customer needs and a dedication to improving service quality across diverse markets.

Finally, optimizing digital channels, particularly the web platform, can enhance the customer complaint experience. With the majority of complaints submitted online, ensuring that the web interface is intuitive, accessible, and fast will significantly improve user experience. Additionally, investing in improving alternative channels like phone and email can support customers who prefer more personalized communication options. A robust, multi-channel approach ensures that all customers have access to the support they need, fostering a positive experience regardless of the platform they choose.
